In this paper, we propose an event-based feature extraction and tracking method for
high dynamic-ranged environments. Unlike other \ac{VO}
methods that utilize frame-wise image data from the \ac{CMOS} sensors, we use data
from event-based vision sensors. While only providing pixel-wise temporal
intensity changes, the \ac{DVS} robustly performs in higher dynamic ranges than a
conventional \ac{CCD} sensor. This characteristic enables the \ac{DVS} to achieve
nearly no loss of pixel information even under drastic light condition changes.
To exploit the obtained events in a \ac{VO}, we introduce an event-based
feature-extraction method and its descriptor, to robustly track features and
lower the position error of \ac{VO} in high dynamic-range environments.
