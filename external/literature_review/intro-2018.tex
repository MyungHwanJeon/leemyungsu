\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Standard camera perceives the data as one frame, and each pixel data is contained in frame data. Because of this characteristic, existing frame-based camera has a limitation that is hard to afford the swift beings. We call it motion blur, frame obscurity phenomenon when the fast object is passing through the sensor.
At first, people tried to detect the optical flow with the standard camera, however, it had trouble since the motion blur. Thus, development of the event perceiving camera has been radically increasing as the emergence of the rapid-moving devices, such as quadcopter. Dynamic Vision Sensor(DVS) is representative event perceiving device, it accepts the data by the pixel and the pixels are asynchronous. Initial stage of DVS development, people used Random Sample Consensus(RANSAC) to track the feature. However, there was problem that the output of RANSAC always changes because of its randomness, and uncertain threshold value could not guarantee its accuracy.
The method finding optical flow after the RANSAC is employing potential data of each pixel. This paper deals with detecting optical flow with DVS-acquired data, potential data from each event pixel is utilized to acquire the object shifting direction data. Every event stacks from DVS are processed by the series of the calculation. Assuming the constant luminance condition, we obtained the gradient variance of data and extracted the data cluster. Speculation of the flow with the event pixel similarity estimation model was ultimately conducted.
