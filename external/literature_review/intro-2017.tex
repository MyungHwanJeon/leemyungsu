\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In machine vision application, \acf{VO} is widely used to estimate camera pose
and to localize position from processing image data. The typical \ac{VO} uses information
from the \ac{APS} sensors, leaving some inherent problems with the frame-based
cameras, weak in high dynamic-range or rapid environments. Frame-based cameras
naturally have blurring and limited dynamic range. That is, even with improved
algorithms, \ac{VO} tends to show lower accuracy in high dynamic-ranged scenes.
The event-based cameras, however, overcame these difficulties, by measuring
the temporal intensity changes of each pixel.

There were recent trials in \ac{VO} with event-based cameras. These algorithms need
precise \ac{APS} images~\cite{kueng2016low} or require additional calculations to
reconstruct intensity image~\cite{CGV-017}. Our goal is to build a method to
extract features only with event information to utilize high temporal
resolution characteristics of the event-based vision sensor.
